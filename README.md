Bfe is a multimode gamemode created for SAMP servers.The project was initially made in Yini based database system but later converted to SQLite (current) version on 26/12/2016.The build 1 was greatly accepted among the community though in my opinion it was full of bug and un optmised script.So on December 2016 i decided make build 2 that comes up with new features as well as optmised more as compared to
build 1.
